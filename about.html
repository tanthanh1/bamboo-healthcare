                    <p>
                        Dr. Steven Bashor obtained his Doctorate Degree from
                        Logan University in Chesterfield, MO in 2019. Dr. Bashor
                        grew up in Cary and always wanted to give back to the
                        community that gave him so much. Prior to getting his
                        Doctorate he attended the University of Illinois at
                        Urbana-Champaign studying Kinesiology.
                    </p>
                    <p>He always had a passion for healthy living and loves to educate patients on the importance of taking care of their body. Dr. Bashor wanted to become a Chiropractor after dealing with his own lower back and elbow issues throughout high school. He received top notch care from a Chiropractor who took the time to listen and truly figure out what the problem was after countless other doctors’ appointments. Dr. Bashor uses a very thorough and well-rounded approach for all of his patients to    ensure they receive the care they need. </p>
                    <p>When Dr. Bashor is not in the office he enjoys spending time with his Fiancé, working out, watching the Cubs or Bears, and walking his two dogs Ava and Tippy. On top of this he is passionate about continuing to build his knowledge on current evidence-based health care approaches to better himself as a Chiropractic Physician. </p>
